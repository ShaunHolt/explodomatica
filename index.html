<p align=center>An automatic explosion sound generator by Stephen M. Cameron
<hr>
<p>This program is an attempt to automatically generate explosion
sound effects for use in video games, etc.

<p>Here's a short demo as of 2011-09-27:

<p>This program mostly just automates in code
something similar to the process which I came up 
ith and documented in this video:<br>

<p>Here is the information you need to get it from github:

<p>Explodomatica is released under the GPL v. 2  (or at your option
any later version).

<p>It relies on libsndfile to write .wav files (see:

NAME
       explodomatica - generate explosion sound effects

SYNOPSIS
       explodomatica [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       An  explosion  sound effect is generated, and saved as mono 44100Hz PCM
       data in the specified wav file.

       -d, --duration
	      Specifies the approximate  duration  in  seconds	the  explosion
	      should last.  Fractional seconds are permitted.

       -l, --nlayers
	      Specifies  the  number  of  sound layers which should be used to
	      create each sub-explosion within the explosion.

       -p, --preexplosions
	      Specifies the number of "preexplosions" to  generate.   You  can
	      think of the "preexplosions" as the "ka" part of "ka-BOOM!"

       --pre-delay
	      Specifies  the  approximate duration in seconds of the "ka" part
	      of "ka-BOOM!".  Default is 0.25 seconds.	The value is  somewhat
	      randomized  and this value is more like an upper bound with zero
	      being the lower bound.

       --pre-lp-factor
	      Specifies the factor to use with the low pass filter on the pre-
	      explosion.   Values  closer  to  zero do more (suppress the pre-
	      explosion more) while values closer to 1 do less.

       --pre-lp-iters
	      Specifies how many times to apply the low  pass  filter  to  the
	      pre-explosion.  Default is 1.

       -s, --speedfactor
	      Specifies the factor by which to speed up or slow down the final
	      explosion sound.	Values greater than 1.0 speed  the  sound  up,
	      values less than 1.0 slow the sound down.  The default is 0.45.

EXAMPLES
       explodomatica --duration 2 --preexplosions 0 --nlayers 3 test.wav
