<p align=center>An automatic explosion sound generator by Stephen M. Cameron
<hr>
<p>This program is an attempt to automatically generate explosion
sound effects for use in video games, etc.

<p>Here's a short demo as of 2011-09-27:

<p>This program mostly just automates in code
something similar to the process which I came up 
ith and documented in this video:<br>

<p>Explodomatica doesn't work very well yet.  It does make explosion
sounds, but it isn't parameterized and it still has a lot of work
before it's all that useful.

<p>Here is the information you need to get it from github:
<a href="http://github.com/smcameron/explodomatica">Explodomatica github page</a>.

<p>Explodomatica is released under the GPL v. 2  (or at your option
any later version).

<p>It relies on libsndfile to write .wav files (see:
