<p>Explodomatica doesn't work very well yet.

<p>Here is the information you need to get it from github:
<a href="http://github.com/smcameron/explodomatica">Explodomatica github page</a>.

<p>Explodomatica is released under the GPL v. 2  (or at your option
any later version).

<p>It relies on libsndfile to write .wav files (see:
